A string is called good if all its charecters form a monotoneous sequence i.e. either increasing or non decreasing order. For ex  **abck** is a good string also **jha** is a good string as it has a monotoneous sequence of charecters. You were given a string S consisting of lower case English alphabets. A substring is contiguous sequence of charecters in a string .The task was to find the total divisions that were to be made in the input string so that all the sepertaed strings be considered as a good string.

**EX**: "abcdcba" is a input user string then for this test case we would divide the strings in two "abcd" & "cba" such that each string is separtaely a good string.
